            Hello! I'm <strong>James Bruning</strong>, a dedicated and passionate <strong>Senior Research Data Analyst</strong> at Northwestern University. With a keen eye for detail and a strong commitment to accuracy, I specialize in transforming complex data sets into actionable insights, aiding in the advancement of research and contributing significantly to my field.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey in data analysis began with the Northwestern Data Science Bootcamp, which eventually led into my Masters of Data Science. Over the years, I have honed my skills in all aspects of data science. I've used my skills to develop Python Machine Learning models to find health care deserts within the US, hoping to find opporutnities to provide better care to those who might need it most. I've also used SQL and Tableau to create advanced but simple to use search tools with space utilizaiton at Northwestern to determine optimal room designation.  What drives me in this field is not just the numbers and patterns, but the stories they tell and the real-world problems they can solve.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Northwestern University, I've had the opportunity to work on simplifying large scale data warehouses for proposals and awards data to help the Vice President and directors of various units to make more informed and higher level decisions. I did this through Tableau, SQL, Cognos business intelligence, and using html and css to design webpages for the curated data. This experience not only solidified my expertise but also underscored the importance of data-driven decision-making in academic research.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not immersed in data, I enjoy reading some type of non-fiction novel (currenlty on Seeking Wisdom), playing some type of sport like pickleball, tennis, or golf, hanging out with my friends or learning some type of new random skill. These activities not only refresh my mind but also provide me with new perspectives that I bring back to my professional life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that continuous learning and collaboration are key to professional growth. I'm always open to discussing new ideas, research projects, or potential collaborations.
